# Next_word_prediction
ðŸš€ Next-Word Predictor using LSTM
I successfully developed a next-word predictor leveraging LSTM networks in deep learning, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99.98%. The project was built using the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks, which facilitated efficient model training and optimization. Key highlights include:

Preprocessing and tokenizing large text datasets for sequential input.

Designing and fine-tuning a multi-layer LSTM architecture for high prediction accuracy.

Using advanced techniques like early stopping and dropout for regularization.

Real-time next-word prediction with minimal latency.


This project helped me enhance my understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP), recurrent networks, and hyperparameterÂ tuning.
